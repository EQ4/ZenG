Zeng
====

Zeng (will probably be renamed soon) is a GUI interface for [ZenGarden](https://github.com/mhroth/ZenGarden), which in
itself is a C++ runtime library for [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/) (Pd) - an audio programming language.

The GUI is written in Objective C and is currently OS X only due using the Cocoa APIs.
